Requires at least: 2.8
Tested up to: 3.0.1
Stable tag: trunk

Plugin has two modes. In navigation mode: Creates a list or table of the current page's child pages. Tables are composed of linked thumbnail pictures based a custom field in each child page, or the child page's attached picture. In gallery mode: Creates one or more tables of linked thumbnail pictures based on the current page's attachments, or on specified directories of picture files under the uploads directory.

== Description ==

Auto Graphics Site Navigation with Gallery

I wrote this plugin to make it easy for me to write graphical page-based Wordpress sites.  I wanted to address these issues:

  * I wanted to create websites with many nested pages, and permit the
    user to navigate among them by clicking on pictures within the
    pages, rather than having to use the Page List.  I wanted to list
    child pages in tables, and have the size of the tables, and the
    number of rows, automatically computed to fit my layout, based on
    the thumbnail sizes.

  * I wanted the thumbnail pictures, and the galleries of pictures I
    added in each page, to have be automatically resized either
    through a single default setting in the Wordpress administration
    page, or by specifying a size in a page I was editing.  I further
    wanted those thumbnails to be automatically generated, or
    regenerated, so there would never be a missing image.

  * I wanted to put all the images for a specific page, in a single
    directory under the wp-content/uploads directory.  This makes it
    easy to add or remove images from FTP or from a command line.  It
    also makes it possible to move an image from one page to another
    -- which is maddeningly difficult if not impossible using
    Wordpress's built-in Attachment system.

This plugin does all that, with two modes.

In navigation mode: Creates a list or table of the current page's
child pages. Tables are composed of linked thumbnail pictures based a
custom field in each child page, or the child page's attached picture.
Example:

    [autonav display="images" pics_only="1"]

displays a table of the current page's child pages.  Only child pages
that have associated pictures will be displayed.  The table will have
3 or 4 columns depending on the default size of the thumbnails and
depending on the column settings in the Wordpress administration
screen.

In gallery mode: Creates one or more tables of linked thumbnail
pictures based on the current page's attachments, or on specified
directories of picture files under the uploads directory. Example:

    [autonav display="/project2" include="32,37,56"]

Displays a table, with a gallery of three pictures from the
wp-content/uploads/project2 directory, in the specified order.

     display="x"     Chooses a display mode based on "x" as follows:
		     images -- displays a table of images, one for each of the child
		          pages of this post. 
		     list -- displays a list of links to the child pages of this post.
		     attached -- displays a table of images attached to the post
		     posts -- displays pages or posts listed in the postid="" parameter
		     /folder -- displays a table of images located in the
		          wp-content/uploads/folder directory
		     Optional parameters, in a comma-separated list:
			  excerpt  -- Display the child page's manual excerpt (see FAQ)
			  thumb    -- Display the page's thumbnail
			  title    -- Display the page's title
			  siblings -- Display sibling pages (other children of parent)
			  self     -- Include this page in siblings (normally excluded)
			Example: display="list,thumb,excerpt"
     caption="x"     Adds a caption to the table. (First table only, see combine below)
     columns="4"     Displays 4 columns of images
     size="x"	     Choose a display size 'x' as:
		     thumbnail, medium, large, full -- Wordpress standard sizes
		     300x200 -- force images to be resized/cropped to an exact size
		     auto -- uses settings from autonav control panel
     titles="1"      Displays page titles below images if 1 (default: "0")
		     (Also set by 'title' parameter to 'display=')
     pics_only="1"   When displaying child pages, only show those with associated images
     include="1,7"   The resulting table will have only two pictures, the first
		     found ending in "1" and "7" -- note that because both 1 and 7
		     are numeric, the image "pic11.jpg" would not be included, but
		     "pic1.jpg" or "pic01.jpg" would be.  For non-numeric values, the 
		     first found picture whose name ends with the value given will
		     be selected.
     combine="x"     Combines table rows as follows (default: "all")
		     all -- all rows combined into one table
		     none -- each row a separate table
		     full -- combine all full rows into one table, with trailing
			  row a separate table (so it can be centered)
     crop="1"        Crops images to fit exact size, or "0" to fit maximum into size.
     start="1"       Starts at the second image or page (counting from zero)
     count="2"       Includes only two images or pages
     imgrel="lightbox" Sets the relation tag of the <a> to be: rel="lightbox"
     group="vacation1" When combined with imgrel="lightbox*" this sets the relation
		       tag to be: rel="lightbox[vacation1]
     exclude="3,5"   Excludes pages with ID 3 and 5 from the list (with display="list")
     postid="123"    Displays images or subpages attached to the page(s) or post(s)
     		     with the given ID, or comma-delimited list of IDs, instead of the
		     current page or post. Can also select posts in category/tag/author.

Parameters not specified will be taken from the values set in the WordPress admin panel.

In addition to a numeric postid, you may select posts as follows:

     postid="category:17"    posts in a numeric category or categories
     postid="category:-17"   posts *not* in a numeric category
     postid="category:cakes" posts by category name
     postid="tag:37,38,53"   posts with numerically specified tag(s)
     postid="tag:chocolate"  posts by tag name
     postid="author:27"      posts by a specific author by ID
     postid="author:Todd"    posts by author name

Categories and tags can also have multiple values separated by commas (posts in
any of the categories or tags) or '+' plus signs (posts which are in all of the
categories or tags).

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Create the autonav-wl directory in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory,
   and place the plugin files there.
2. Activate the plugin through the administration menus in Wordpress.
3. Configure the plugin under Settings in the Wordpress administration menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I set the thumbnail for a page? =

In Wordpress 2.9 and later, the thumbnail you choose in the page's
edit screen becomes the default thumbnail. If you do not choose a
thumbnail there (or in Wordpress versions below 2.9), the attached
image with the lowest order (chosen in the Gallery section of the
page's image attachment dialog) becomes the default thumbnail.

You can override the default thumbnail by creating a Custom Field
called subpage_thumb for the page.  Set it to either a URL:

    http://www.example.com/images/thumbnail3.jpg

or to a local file (assumed to be under the uploads directory of your
wp-content):

    optional_directory/picture3.jpg

In the latter case, point to the full-sized image, and the thumbnail
will automatically be resized.

= How do I enable post thumbnails in Wordpress? =

If you don't see the Post Thumbnail section in your administration
screens, add this to your theme's functions.php --

  <?php add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' ); ?>

= How do I override the title for a child page? =

Create a Custom Field called subpage_title for the page.  Set it to
what you would like displayed in the table or list of child pages.

= What CSS classes does this plugin create? =	    

In navigation mode, when a list is selected:

   * ul elements have class: subpages-list
   * li elements have class: subpages-item
   * Excerpt text: subpages-excerpt
   * Thumbnail images: subpages-list-image

In table modes:

   * table elements: subpages-table
   * tr elements: subpages-row
   * td elements: subpages-cell
   * p elements inside each td: subpages-text
   * Excerpt text: subpages-excerpt

The 'subpages' prefix may be overridden by the 'class' parameter or 
on the administration screen.

= I updated the plugin, but the new parameters are not recognized. =

Go through the Autonav Options on the Wordpress administration screen
once, and save the options. That will add the new parameter names to
the list of recognized ones.

= Can I re-attach an attachment to another page? =

Thry the Change Attachment Parent plugin, which is an easy way to
reset the parent page or post for any attachment, right on the
attachment's Edit screen in the Media Library. You do need to know the
new parent's ID, though.

    http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/change-attachment-parent/

= How can I rearrange my pages? =

Try the Pagemash plugin which lets you move pages up, down, in, out,
and around your hierarchy with the mouse.  It automatically changes
the pages' parents and menu order.

    http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pagemash/

= Does this plugin create database tables? =

No, only the one entry which holds the settings.  This is in the
wp_options table, with option_name = "autonav_wl" and that will be
updated by going through the AutoNav administration screen (see above).

= I get an error that imagecreatefromjpeg is not defined =

Your webserver needs GD image support in PHP. On Debian or Ubuntu,
you can install that with apt-get, and then restart Apache. 
For example:

   $ sudo apt-get install php5-gd
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

= Can I disable certain attached images? =

Yes, using the Media Library in the admin screens, set an image's Order
to -101 or less, and it will not be shown with [autonav display=attached]

You can also set the post_status of an attachment to 'private' or
'draft' although Wordpress gives you no menus to do this, and as of
Wordpress 2.9 the Media Manager has some problems (showing size=0)
with attachments so set.

= Some of my images do not appear. =

If you upload a picture with a filename that resembles Wordpress' resized
image names, the Autonav plugin may not be able to find it.  For example,
if you upload a picture called mybike-640x528.jpg, Wordpress will create
thumbnails and there will be three files in the uploads directory:

	mybike-640x528.jpg
	mybike-640x528-150x150.jpg
	mybike-640x528-300x247.jpg

Autonav will not find your "full size" picture, the 640x528 one, because it
ends in a dash followed by two numbers with an 'x' inbetween.  You will have 
to rename your original picture before uploading it into Wordpress.

= How do I add manual excerpts to pages? =

By default, Wordpress (as of v2.9) includes the ability to edit manual excerpts
only for Posts, not Pages.  You can add a few lines of code to your theme's
functions.php to enable the functional for Pages as well, see:

     http://mfields.org/2008/04/02/how-to-activate-excerpts-for-pages-in-wordpress-admin-panel/

= Can I call the plugin from a template? =

Yes, you may use this code in your template, for example, where you
wish a table of child pages' thumbnails:

  <?php print autonav_wl_shortcode(array('display'=>'images')); ?>

or where you would like a table of all attached images:

  <?php print autonav_wl_shortcode(array('display'=>'attached')); ?>

= Can I show all attachments, but highlight the first couple? =

Yes; try these three lines:

    [autonav display=attached columns=1 count=1 size=500x500]
    [autonav display=attached columns=1 start=1 count=1 size=300x300]
    [autonav display=attached columns=4 start=2]

You could even include similar calls in a template (see above), showing the 
first attachment in the large size in one place, the second attachment in
medium size elsewhere, and all remaining attachments at perhaps the bottom.

= Can I display tooltips? =

Yes, when displaying attached images, the image's Title as set through the
Wordpress admin screen is put into the 'a' tag's title attribute. On modern
browsers this becomes a tooltip when hovering over the image inside the anchor.
