Use new WP_Image_Editor class

http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Image_Editor

    $image = wp_get_image_editor( 'cool_image.jpg' ); 
    // Return an implementation that extends <tt>WP_Image_Editor</tt>

    if (Â ! is_wp_error( $image ) ) {
        $image->rotate( 90 );
	$image->crop(src_x, src_y, src_width, src_height);
        $image->resize( 300, 300, true );
        $image->save( 'new_image.jpg' );
    }

 -- note, save() with no arguments automatically uses the original filename and extension,
    but appends the "-300x300" at the appropriate place (thereby eliminating quite a bit of
    our code).  (~~~ VERIFY!)

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_get_image_editor

 -- note, you can retrieve an image by URL!  However save() requires a local filename...
    which probably ought to live under the uploads/ directory... somehow?  
    ~~~ Find best practices.

Another example, although recommend using wp_get_image_editor() instead:

Support version 3.6 functions to grab images from galleries, not just actually Attached images

As per http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22960

Newest info: (2013-07-07)

get_content_galleries() grabs [gallery]s from passed content and returns structured data, which currently is only one node: src ,which contains a list of image URLs. In the future, more nodes can hold more data about the gallery
